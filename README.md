# Chipotle Racing Bot
Bot program for Chipotle's promotional 'Race to Rewards' game (See: https://racetorewards.com).

This bot program was written over the course of a day when I found out about 
Chipotle's Race to Rewards game, where they were awarding a Tesla car to the number 1 
leaderboard position. 

Unfortunately, the bot did not win the top spot, but it did perform fairly well.

The top leaderboard spot held by the bot was 14th, and as more people entered it started to drop to about the mid 20's.


## Running the bot
To run this bot, make sure to install all of the python packages in the `requirements.txt` file. 
After that, run the bot in the terminal using something like `python3 script.py`. When the bot starts,
make sure you have the browser window selected (i.e. click on it), so that the key presses will trigger events
in the browser.

One thing to note is that this bot was developed on a 1920x1080 monitor resolution, so if you are using this bot on a different monitor size
it will probably not work.
